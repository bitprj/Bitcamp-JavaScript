### Concatenating words in a sentence

Create a function that, given an array of strings, returns a sentence of all the words in that order. That is, concatenate all of the provided strings with spaces in between and a period at the end.

Use what you learned from the TwilioQuest streams so far to write a function, write a for loop over the input strings, and return the final sentence!

**Task 2: Complete a function that creates a sentence as described above!**


Great job, the robots can speak now, and they keep asking for more batteries!
