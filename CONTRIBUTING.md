# Contributing
## Course, Repo Format
Each course consists of two large components, a weekly live stream and weekly asynchronous homework assignments.
- Livestream :lightning_cloud:
These are projects that the course facilitators will develop for students to learn the core skills and use as reference in completing homework and building their projects.
- Homework
Homework is assigned in the form of issues in a Github Learning Lab. The config.yml file describes the progression of the course, as students open and close issues to progress along with the curriculum. Follow this video to see the structure of the issue files in the course:

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent
You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add a link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that

> Add a link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.
