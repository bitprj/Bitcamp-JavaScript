### FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a program used to demonstrate basic functionality of a language, often when switching between programing languages or as an introduction (that's us!) to first learning a language.

The goals of the program is to go through the numbers from 1 to 100 and print "fizz" whenever a number is divisible by 3, print "buzz" when it's divisible by 5, print "fizzbuzz" when it's divisible by both 3 and 5, and print the number when it's not divisible by either. For our program, you will do something very similar:

For the numbers from 1 to 100:
* print ðŸ‘½ and the number if it is divisible by 3
* print ðŸš€ and the number if it is divisible by 5
* print ðŸ›° and the number if it is divisible by both 3 and 5
* print ðŸ’© and the number if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5

Tip: copy paste the emojis to get it into your code!
