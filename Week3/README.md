### Learning Outcomes
- Get comfortable with JavaScript syntax for:

    - Strings and string Functions, Arrays, and Lists
    - Functions, parameters, and returns
- Prepare for your final project next week

### List of needed technologies:

- A text editor

### Link to relevant resources:
- [Everything there is to know about javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)


### Livestream

We'll be going over how to write full programs in javascript, bringing together everything you've learned so far playing TwilioQuest. It is okay if you don't finish the game itself, but if you're stuck on the homework or coming up with ideas for your final project, that would be a good place to start.

### Homework

Your task is to complete one larger program (Roman to Int) and complete as much of TwilioQuest as you can through for the week. We will be exclusively working on the final project next week, so you will also have a brainstorming session assigned with your mentor this week. Please come prepared to that session with ideas for what you want to make in your final week!
