## Final Project

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### Brainstorming ideas for your final project

We will be exclusively working on the final project next week, so you will also have a brainstorming session assigned with your mentor this week. Please come prepared to that session with ideas for what you want to make in your final week!

Your job is to come prepared and take notes during that meeting, so we can discuss project ideas and go through an example project for the livestream in week 4.

**Task 2: Get ready for your final project next week and learn from your mentor!**


Great job, you're all set to keep questing after returning from the space shuttle.
